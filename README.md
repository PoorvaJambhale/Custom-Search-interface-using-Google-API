# Custom Search interface using Google API
----------------------------------------
Code is implemented using Java, JSP, HTML5 ,CSS and JavaScript. I used Google's JSON/Atom custom search API and the interface was hosted as a web service using AWS EC2. Preprocessed data by eliminating stop words, case folding and stemming and re-ranked search results using user feedback and implementing Cosine similarity and MapReduce.
